Build a backend with two REST APIs using FastAPI (or similar):
Document Ingestion API
Upload .pdf or .txt files
Extract text, apply two chunking strategies (selectable)
Generate embeddings & store in Pinecone/Qdrant/Weaviate/Milvus
Save metadata in SQL/NoSQL DB
Conversational RAG API
Custom RAG (no RetrievalQAChain)
Use Redis for chat memory
Handle multi-turn queries
Support interview booking (name, email, date, time)
Send confirmation email (SMTP/3rd party) & store booking info
Evaluation & Report:

Compare two chunking methods and two similarity search algorithms on:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Latency
Provide findings & recommendations in a concise report (upload to GitHub).
Constraints:

No FAISS/Chroma, no UI, no RetrievalQAChain clean modular code following industry standards for typing and annotations
